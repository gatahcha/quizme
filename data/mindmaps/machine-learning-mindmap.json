      "detailed": "Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples we provide.",
