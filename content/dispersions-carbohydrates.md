# Dispersions and Carbohydrates - Chemical & Physical Properties of Food

## Overview

Foods are complex mixtures of chemicals that range from simple sugars to complex structures found in milk and muscle foods. These components interact to produce sensory, chemical, and physical characteristics that determine food behavior under different conditions. This content covers two major areas: food dispersions (colloidal systems) and carbohydrates. Food dispersions involve small particle systems where substances are distributed without dissolving, creating various textures and structures in foods. Carbohydrates, one of the four major food components, serve as the body's main energy source and play crucial functional roles in food systems, from providing sweetness to creating structure and texture through gelation and thickening.

## Topic Hierarchy

### Food Dispersions

**Summary**: Colloidal dispersions are small particle systems where particles of one substance (dispersed phase) are distributed in another substance (continuous phase) without dissolving, with particle sizes less than 600 microns.

**Detailed Content**:
Food dispersions are fundamental to understanding food structure and texture. In a dispersion, particles of one substance are distributed throughout another substance without actually dissolving. The dispersed phase is the substance that is distributed, while the continuous phase is the substance in which particles are distributed. These systems are characterized by small particle sizes (less than 600 microns), which distinguishes them from coarser suspensions. The nature of both phases (solid, liquid, or gas) determines the type of dispersion and its properties. Understanding dispersions is essential for food formulation, as they affect appearance, texture, stability, and overall sensory properties of foods.

**Key Points**:
- Particles must be smaller than 600 microns
- Dispersed phase is distributed in continuous phase without dissolving
- Both phases can be solid, liquid, or gas
- Critical for food texture and stability
- Affects sensory properties and appearance

**Examples**:
- Milk (oil-in-water emulsion)
- Mayonnaise (oil-in-water emulsion)
- Butter (water-in-oil solid emulsion)
- Whipped cream (gas-in-liquid foam)
- Ice cream (gas-in-solid foam)

**Tags**: dispersions, colloidal-systems, food-structure, phases, particle-systems

#### Types of Food Dispersions

**Summary**: Food dispersions are classified based on the state of matter of both the dispersed and continuous phases, creating six main types: sol, gel, foam, solid foam, emulsion, and solid emulsion.

**Detailed Content**:
The classification of food dispersions depends on whether the dispersed and continuous phases are solid, liquid, or gas. A **sol** has solid particles dispersed in a liquid (like starch in water). A **gel** has liquid dispersed in a solid matrix (like pectin jams or gelatin desserts). **Foams** have gas dispersed in liquid (whipped egg whites), while **solid foams** have gas in solid (bread, meringue). **Emulsions** are liquid-in-liquid dispersions (milk, salad dressings), and **solid emulsions** have liquid in solid (butter, margarine). Each type has distinct properties and applications in food systems. The stability and functionality of these dispersions often require stabilizers, emulsifiers, or thickening agents to maintain their structure.

**Key Points**:
- Six main types based on phase combinations
- Sol: solid in liquid (proteins, starches in water)
- Gel: liquid in solid (jams, jellies, tofu)
- Foam: gas in liquid (whipped egg whites)
- Solid foam: gas in solid (bread, ice cream, meringue)
- Emulsion: liquid in liquid (milk, mayonnaise)
- Solid emulsion: liquid in solid (butter, margarine)

**Examples**:
- Sol: starch solutions, protein dispersions
- Gel: jam, jelly, tofu, gelatin desserts
- Foam: cake frosting, whipped cream
- Solid foam: bread, meringue, ice cream
- Emulsion: milk, mayonnaise, salad dressings
- Solid emulsion: butter, margarine

**Tags**: sol, gel, foam, emulsion, dispersion-types, food-classification

#### Emulsions

**Summary**: Emulsions are liquid-in-liquid dispersions where one liquid is dispersed as droplets in another immiscible liquid, classified as oil-in-water (o/w) or water-in-oil (w/o) based on which phase is continuous.

**Detailed Content**:
Emulsions are one of the most important types of food dispersions. They consist of two immiscible liquids where one is dispersed as small droplets in the other. The internal (dispersed) phase consists of droplets, while the external (continuous) phase surrounds these droplets. Oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions have oil droplets dispersed in water, such as milk and mayonnaise (liquid emulsions). Water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions have water droplets in oil, like butter and margarine (solid emulsions). Emulsions are inherently unstable and require emulsifiers to prevent separation. The type of emulsion affects texture, mouthfeel, and stability. Temperature, pH, and mechanical processing can affect emulsion stability.

**Key Points**:
- Two types: oil-in-water (o/w) and water-in-oil (w/o)
- Internal phase = dispersed phase (droplets)
- External phase = continuous phase (surrounds droplets)
- Require emulsifiers for stability
- Can be liquid or solid emulsions

**Examples**:
- O/W liquid emulsion: milk, mayonnaise, salad dressings
- W/O solid emulsion: butter, margarine
- O/W with protein emulsifier: mayonnaise (egg yolk)
- O/W with polysaccharides: low-fat mayonnaise

**Tags**: emulsions, oil-in-water, water-in-oil, emulsifiers, liquid-dispersions

#### Mayonnaise as Example Emulsion

**Summary**: Mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion where oil droplets are dispersed in vinegar (water) with egg yolk acting as the emulsifier, demonstrating the importance of emulsifiers in stabilizing immiscible liquids.

**Detailed Content**:
Mayonnaise is a classic example of an oil-in-water emulsion, containing approximately 75% oil dispersed in vinegar (water phase). Despite having more oil than water, it remains an o/w emulsion because water is the continuous phase. Egg yolk serves as the emulsifier, containing phospholipids (lecithin) that have both water-loving (hydrophilic) and fat-loving (lipophilic) components. These molecules position themselves at the oil-water interface, with hydrophilic parts extending into water and lipophilic parts into oil, preventing droplets from coalescing. The rate and order of oil addition during preparation is critical for proper emulsion formation. In low-fat mayonnaise, modified starches are added to compensate for reduced oil content and maintain proper viscosity and mouthfeel. Low-fat versions remain o/w emulsions despite lower oil content, but require additional stabilizers for proper texture.

**Key Points**:
- Oil-in-water emulsion (~75% oil but water is continuous phase)
- Egg yolk is the emulsifier (contains lecithin)
- Rate and order of oil addition is critical
- Low-fat versions use modified starches for viscosity
- Emulsifier prevents oil droplets from coalescing

**Examples**:
- Regular mayonnaise: egg yolk, oil, vinegar, seasonings
- Low-fat mayonnaise: adds modified corn and potato starch
- Homemade mayonnaise: demonstrates importance of proper technique
- Broken mayonnaise: shows what happens without proper emulsification

**Tags**: mayonnaise, emulsion-example, egg-yolk, emulsifier, lecithin, low-fat-foods

#### Foams

**Summary**: Foams are dispersions of gas bubbles in a liquid or solid continuous phase, created by incorporating air through mechanical action, with stability provided by surface-active agents like proteins.

**Detailed Content**:
Foams are gas-in-liquid or gas-in-solid dispersions where gas bubbles are trapped in a continuous phase. In liquid foams (gas in liquid), air is beaten into a liquid like egg whites to create structures such as cake frostings or whipped cream. The egg white proteins act as stabilizers, forming films around air bubbles. Solid foams (gas in solid) include products like meringue, ice cream, and bread where gas is incorporated into a structure that then solidifies. The stability of foams depends on the surface tension of the liquid, the presence of stabilizing agents (proteins, emulsifiers), and the size and distribution of gas bubbles. Foams contribute to texture, volume, and mouthfeel in many food products.

**Key Points**:
- Gas dispersed in liquid (foam) or solid (solid foam)
- Created by mechanical incorporation of air
- Require stabilizers (proteins, emulsifiers)
- Liquid foams: whipped cream, cake frosting
- Solid foams: meringue, bread, ice cream
- Stability depends on bubble size and stabilizers

**Examples**:
- Liquid foams: whipped egg whites, whipped cream, cake frosting
- Solid foams: meringue, ice cream, bread, marshmallows
- Protein-stabilized: egg white foams
- Fat-stabilized: whipped cream

**Tags**: foams, gas-dispersions, whipped-products, aeration, foam-stability

### Carbohydrates - Simple Sugars

**Summary**: Carbohydrates are organic compounds that serve as the body's main energy source, classified as simple (mono- and disaccharides) or complex (polysaccharides), with digestible forms providing 4 calories per gram.

**Detailed Content**:
Carbohydrates are one of the four major food components (along with fats, proteins, and water) and are the body's primary energy source. They are organic compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Digestible carbohydrates provide 4 calories per gram and should contribute approximately 50% of daily caloric intake, preferably in the form of complex carbohydrates rather than simple sugars. Carbohydrates are found mainly in plant-based foods including fruits, vegetables, grain products, and legumes. The only significant animal-source carbohydrate is lactose in milk. Simple carbohydrates include monosaccharides (single sugar molecules) and disaccharides (two sugar molecules joined together), while complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides) are long chains of sugar molecules. The chemical structure and complexity of carbohydrates determine their sweetness, digestibility, and functional properties in foods.

**Key Points**:
- Body's main energy source (4 Cal/gram for digestible forms)
- Should provide ~50% of daily caloric intake
- Prefer complex over simple carbohydrates
- Found mainly in plant foods
- Classified as simple or complex based on structure
- Affect sensory, chemical, and physical food properties

**Examples**:
- Simple sugars: glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose
- Complex carbohydrates: starch, fiber, cellulose
- Food sources: fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, milk
- Applications: sweeteners, thickeners, gelling agents

**Tags**: carbohydrates, energy-source, organic-compounds, nutrition, macronutrients

#### Monosaccharides

**Summary**: Monosaccharides are single sugar molecules (simple sugars) not bonded to other sugars, including glucose, fructose, and galactose, all with the formula C₆H₁₂O₆ but differing in molecular structure and sweetness.

**Detailed Content**:
Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates, consisting of single sugar molecules that cannot be broken down into simpler sugars. The three most important monosaccharides in food are glucose (dextrose), fructose (levulose), and galactose. All three have the same molecular formula (C₆H₁₂O₆) but are isomers with different structural arrangements, which significantly affects their properties. Glucose has a sweetness index of 70-80 compared to sucrose at 100, while fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar with an index of 140. Galactose (sweetness index 60) rarely occurs free in foods but is part of lactose. The differences in molecular structure affect how these sugars interact with taste receptors on the tongue, determining their relative sweetness. These sugars are readily absorbed and metabolized by the body.

**Key Points**:
- Single sugar molecules (C₆H₁₂O₆)
- Three main types: glucose, fructose, galactose
- Isomers with same formula but different structures
- Sweetness varies by structure: fructose (140) > glucose (70-80) > galactose (60)
- Readily digestible and absorbed
- Sweetness determined by molecular structure and taste receptor interaction

**Examples**:
- Glucose: corn syrup, blood sugar, honey
- Fructose: fruits, honey, high fructose corn syrup
- Galactose: component of lactose (milk sugar)
- Applications: sweeteners, fermentation substrates

**Tags**: monosaccharides, glucose, fructose, galactose, simple-sugars, sweetness-index

#### Disaccharides

**Summary**: Disaccharides are formed by joining two monosaccharide molecules through a glycosidic bond, including sucrose (glucose-fructose), lactose (galactose-glucose), and maltose (glucose-glucose), each with distinct properties and sources.

**Detailed Content**:
Disaccharides are carbohydrates formed when two monosaccharide molecules bond together through a condensation reaction, releasing water. The three most important disaccharides in food are sucrose, lactose, and maltose. Sucrose (table sugar, sweetness index 100) is composed of glucose and fructose joined together and is found in fruits, vegetables, and commercially extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets at >99.5% purity. Lactose (milk sugar, sweetness index 10-20) consists of galactose and glucose and is found naturally only in milk (4-5% in cow's milk, 6-8% in human milk). Maltose (malt sugar, sweetness index 20) contains two glucose molecules and is formed during starch breakdown by enzymes (amylase) or acids. Disaccharides can be split back into monosaccharides by enzymes or boiling with dilute acids, a process called hydrolysis.

**Key Points**:
- Union of two monosaccharide molecules
- Three main types: sucrose, lactose, maltose
- Can be hydrolyzed by enzymes or acids
- Sweetness varies: sucrose (100), maltose (20), lactose (10-20)
- Each has specific food sources and applications

**Examples**:
- Sucrose: table sugar, fruits, commercial white sugar (>99.5% pure)
- Lactose: cow's milk (4-5%), human milk (6-8%)
- Maltose: formed from starch breakdown, beer, malted products

**Tags**: disaccharides, sucrose, lactose, maltose, hydrolysis, glycosidic-bonds

#### Sucrose and Invert Sugar

**Summary**: Sucrose (table sugar) is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose that can be hydrolyzed by the enzyme invertase or acid to produce invert sugar, a sweeter 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose with different functional properties.

**Detailed Content**:
Sucrose is the most common dietary sugar, found naturally in various fruits (6-12% in peaches, tangerines, pineapples, mangoes) and commercially produced at >99.5% purity from sugar cane or sugar beets. When sucrose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme invertase or by acids, it breaks down into equal amounts of glucose and fructose, called invert sugar. This mixture has a sweetness index of 100-130 compared to sucrose's 100, making it sweeter due to fructose's high sweetness (140). The molecular equation shows: Sucrose (342g) + Water (18g) → Glucose (180g) + Fructose (180g) = 360g total. Invert sugar is highly hygroscopic (attracts moisture) and is used in candy making to prevent products from drying out and becoming brittle. Honey naturally contains invert sugar (40:60 glucose:fructose ratio) formed by invertase in bee saliva. The non-1:1 ratio in honey occurs because bees also forage on nectars containing other sugars besides sucrose.

**Key Points**:
- Sucrose = glucose + fructose (sweetness index 100)
- Hydrolysis by invertase or acid produces invert sugar
- Invert sugar is 1:1 glucose:fructose mixture (sweeter than sucrose)
- Highly hygroscopic (attracts and retains moisture)
- Used to prevent candy from becoming brittle
- Honey contains natural invert sugar (40:60 ratio)

**Examples**:
- Sucrose sources: table sugar (>99.5%), fruits, sugar cane juice
- Invert sugar: candy making, chewy candies, liquid centers
- Honey: natural invert sugar from invertase enzyme
- Applications: moisture retention, preventing crystallization

**Tags**: sucrose, invert-sugar, invertase, hydrolysis, honey, hygroscopic

#### Lactose

**Summary**: Lactose (milk sugar) is a disaccharide of galactose and glucose found exclusively in milk, with low sweetness (10-20 index) and importance in dairy products and lactose intolerance.

**Detailed Content**:
Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose molecules, found naturally only in milk and dairy products. Cow's milk contains approximately 4-5% lactose, while human milk has 6-8%. Lactose has a relatively low sweetness index of 10-20, making it the least sweet of the common sugars. It can be fermented by lactic acid bacteria in products like yogurt and cheese, producing lactic acid that acts as both an acidulant and preservative. Lactose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme lactase in the small intestine; people with lactose intolerance lack sufficient lactase enzyme. Lactose-hydrolyzed milk (like Lactaid) has had lactose broken down into glucose and galactose, making it sweeter than regular milk because the component monosaccharides (glucose 70-80, galactose 60) have higher sweetness indices than lactose (10-20). Despite identical carbohydrate content on nutrition labels, lactose-free milk tastes sweeter due to this change in sugar composition.

**Key Points**:
- Galactose + glucose (sweetness index 10-20)
- Found only in milk: cow's (4-5%), human (6-8%)
- Least sweet of common disaccharides
- Fermented by lactic acid bacteria
- Requires lactase enzyme for digestion
- Lactose-free milk is sweeter due to hydrolysis

**Examples**:
- Cow's milk (4-5% lactose)
- Human breast milk (6-8% lactose)
- Lactose-free milk (lactose hydrolyzed to glucose + galactose)
- Fermented products: yogurt, cheese (lactic acid produced)

**Tags**: lactose, milk-sugar, lactase, lactose-intolerance, fermentation, dairy-products

#### Maltose and High Fructose Corn Syrup

**Summary**: Maltose (malt sugar) is a disaccharide of two glucose molecules formed from starch breakdown, serving as an intermediate in producing high fructose corn syrup through enzymatic processing.

**Detailed Content**:
Maltose is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules linked by an α-1,4 glycosidic bond, with a sweetness index of only 20. It is not naturally abundant in foods but is formed during the enzymatic (amylase) or acid hydrolysis of starch. The production of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) involves a multi-step process starting with starch. First, starch (amylose, which is not sweet) is hydrolyzed by amylase or acid to produce maltose (slightly sweet, index 20). Second, maltose is further hydrolyzed by the enzyme maltase to produce glucose (sweet, index 70-80). Third, glucose is isomerized using glucose isomerase enzyme to convert some glucose to fructose, producing HFCS with varying fructose concentrations. Common HFCS formulations include 42% fructose (sweetness index 100), 55% fructose (100+), and 90% fructose (120-160). The high fructose content makes HFCS very sweet and cost-effective for commercial applications.

**Key Points**:
- Two glucose molecules (sweetness index 20)
- Formed from starch by amylase or acid hydrolysis
- Intermediate in HFCS production
- Three-step HFCS process: starch→maltose→glucose→fructose
- Enzymes used: amylase, maltase, glucose isomerase
- HFCS varieties: 42%, 55%, 90% fructose content

**Examples**:
- Maltose: beer, malted products, starch breakdown products
- HFCS 42%: soft drinks, processed foods
- HFCS 55%: soft drinks, baked goods
- HFCS 90%: high-intensity sweetener applications

**Tags**: maltose, high-fructose-corn-syrup, HFCS, glucose-isomerase, enzymatic-conversion, starch-hydrolysis

### Functional Properties of Simple Carbohydrates

**Summary**: Simple carbohydrates perform multiple functional roles in foods beyond sweetening, including participation in browning reactions, crystallization, providing viscosity, fermentation substrate, antimicrobial properties, and moisture retention (humectancy).

**Detailed Content**:
Simple carbohydrates have diverse functional properties that make them valuable in food formulation beyond their role as sweeteners. Their sweetening power varies by molecular structure and interaction with taste receptors, with fructose being significantly sweeter than glucose or lactose despite all providing similar calories. They participate in non-enzymatic browning reactions (caramelization and Maillard reaction) that develop color and flavor. Sugars can crystallize from solution or remain in syrupy states, affecting texture. They contribute to viscosity and mouthfeel of products. Sugars serve as fermentation substrates for microorganisms in bread, beer, and fermented foods. At high concentrations, sugars act as antimicrobial agents by reducing water activity. Many sugars, especially invert sugars, are hygroscopic (attracting and retaining moisture), which affects product texture and shelf life.

**Key Points**:
- Sweetening power varies by molecular structure
- Sweetness not correlated with caloric content
- Participate in browning reactions
- Can crystallize or remain syrupy
- Affect viscosity and mouthfeel
- Fermentation substrates for microorganisms
- Antimicrobial at high concentrations
- Hygroscopic (moisture retention)

**Examples**:
- Sweetening: fructose requires 1/7 the amount of lactose for equal sweetness
- Browning: caramel color, toast, cookies
- Crystallization: rock candy, table sugar, honey granulation
- Viscosity: syrups, honey
- Fermentation: bread, beer, yogurt
- Preservation: jams, honey
- Humectancy: chewy cookies, soft candies

**Tags**: functional-properties, sweetness, browning, crystallization, viscosity, fermentation, antimicrobial, humectancy

#### Non-Enzymatic Browning Reactions

**Summary**: Non-enzymatic browning occurs through two mechanisms: caramelization (heating sugar alone at high temperatures) and Maillard reaction (reducing sugar plus amino compounds), both producing brown pigments and flavor compounds.

**Detailed Content**:
Non-enzymatic browning reactions are crucial for developing color and flavor in cooked foods. **Caramelization** occurs when sugars are heated alone to high temperatures (110-203°C/200°C+), breaking down sugar molecules to produce aromatic compounds with caramel and butterscotch flavors, plus brown pigments. This occurs in caramel candies, toffees, and cola beverage coloring. **Maillard browning** (named after Louis Maillard) requires both a reducing sugar and amino compounds (like proteins or amino acids). Reducing sugars have a "free" hydroxyl group next to the oxygen in the ring structure, including glucose, fructose, galactose, lactose, and maltose. Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar but can participate after being hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose by heat or acid. The Maillard reaction produces low molecular weight intermediate compounds (aromas and flavors, both desirable and undesirable) and high molecular weight polymers called melanoidins (brown-black pigments). Examples include toast, roasted coffee, potato chips, bread crust, and even sunless tanning lotions.

**Key Points**:
- Two types: caramelization and Maillard reaction
- Caramelization: sugar alone at high temp (110-203°C)
- Maillard: reducing sugar + amino compounds
- Caramelization produces caramel/butterscotch flavors
- Maillard produces complex flavors and aromas
- Both produce brown pigments
- Reducing sugars have free OH group
- Sucrose can participate after hydrolysis

**Examples**:
- Caramelization: caramel candy, toffee, cola color, crème brûlée
- Maillard: toast, roasted coffee, bread crust, grilled meat, potato chips
- Desirable: baked goods, roasted coffee, chocolate
- Undesirable: off-flavors in stored milk powder
- Unusual: sunless tanning lotions use Maillard reaction on skin

**Tags**: non-enzymatic-browning, caramelization, maillard-reaction, reducing-sugars, melanoidins, flavor-development

#### Crystallization and Humectancy

**Summary**: Sugars can exist in crystalline or dissolved states, with crystallization behavior affecting texture; hygroscopic sugars attract and retain moisture, preventing products from drying out or causing them to become sticky depending on application.

**Detailed Content**:
Sugar crystallization is important in candy making and product stability. Sugars can be crystallized from solution (like table sugar from cane juice) or maintained in syrupy states. The ability to control crystallization determines texture in products like fondant (fine crystals), fudge, and hard candies. Preventing unwanted crystallization requires factors like controlling temperature, using inverted sugars, or adding interfering agents. Humectancy refers to the ability of sugars to attract and hold moisture. Simple carbohydrates, especially invert sugars (glucose and fructose), are highly hygroscopic. This property has dual effects: in candies and baked goods, it prevents drying and maintains soft, chewy textures, but it can also cause problems like sticky lollipops that absorb atmospheric moisture. In liquid-centered chocolates, invertase enzyme is added to crystallized sucrose centers; during storage (ripening), the enzyme slowly converts sucrose to the more hygroscopic glucose-fructose mixture, which doesn't crystallize easily and produces a soft, syrupy center.

**Key Points**:
- Sugars can be crystalline or dissolved
- Crystallization affects texture and stability
- Invert sugars are highly hygroscopic
- Hygroscopicity prevents drying (beneficial)
- Can cause stickiness (problematic)
- Liquid centers use invertase ripening effect
- Sucrose crystallizes easily, invert sugar doesn't

**Examples**:
- Crystallization: table sugar, rock candy, fondant
- Humectancy benefits: soft cookies, chewy candies, fresh bread
- Humectancy problems: sticky lollipops, cake
- Liquid-centered chocolates: invertase converts crystalline sucrose to liquid invert sugar
- Prevention: invert sugar in chewy candies

**Tags**: crystallization, humectancy, hygroscopic, invert-sugar, liquid-centers, invertase, moisture-retention

### Polysaccharides

**Summary**: Polysaccharides are high molecular weight polymers consisting of long chains of monosaccharide units, including structural components (cellulose, pectins) and energy storage molecules (starch, glycogen), with applications as thickeners, gelling agents, and stabilizers.

**Detailed Content**:
Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates composed of hundreds to thousands of monosaccharide units linked together. Unlike simple sugars, they are usually insoluble in water, tasteless, and have no sweetness. They serve two main biological roles: structural components in plants (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, gums) that provide firmness to tissues, and energy storage molecules in plants (starch) and animals (glycogen). In food applications, polysaccharides are valuable for their functional properties rather than nutritional or sweetening value. They are sourced from plants, seaweed, plant exudates (gums), and microbial products. Common food polysaccharides include pectin, agar, alginates, carrageenan, gum arabic, xanthan gum, starch, and cellulose. Their applications include thickening, suspending solids in liquids, stabilizing emulsions, and forming gels. The type and concentration of polysaccharide used dramatically affects food texture and stability.

**Key Points**:
- High molecular weight polymers (>500 monosaccharide units)
- Usually insoluble in water and tasteless
- Two roles: structural support and energy storage
- Sources: plants, seaweed, exudates, microbes
- Applications: thickening, suspending, stabilizing, gelling
- Differ greatly from simple sugars in properties

**Examples**:
- Structural: cellulose, pectin, gums (plant firmness)
- Energy storage: starch (plants), glycogen (animals)
- Thickeners: xanthan gum, guar gum
- Gelling agents: pectin, agar, carrageenan
- Stabilizers: carrageenan, alginates

**Tags**: polysaccharides, complex-carbohydrates, thickeners, gelling-agents, stabilizers, food-structure

#### Food Gums and Stabilizers

**Summary**: Various polysaccharides extracted from plants, seaweed, and microbes serve as thickening, suspending, and stabilizing agents in food products, including pectin, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan gum, and gum arabic.

**Detailed Content**:
Food gums are polysaccharides used primarily for their thickening, suspending, and stabilizing properties. **Pectin**, extracted from plant tissues (especially citrus peels and apple pomace), is used as a gelling agent in jams and jellies, contributes to viscosity in ketchup and tomato paste, and helps maintain particles in suspension in orange juice. **Alginates**, extracted from brown seaweed, are used as suspending and thickening agents in salad dressings, puddings, pie fillings, ice cream, and icings. **Carrageenan** (Irish moss extract), also from seaweed, is a suspending agent and stabilizer in dairy products, keeping cocoa particles suspended in chocolate milk and preventing ice crystal formation in ice cream. **Xanthan gum**, produced by bacterial fermentation (Xanthomonas campestris), controls viscosity in salad dressings and provides "loaf structure" in wheat-free bread. **Gum arabic (acacia)**, from tree sap, is a thickening agent used in candies. Each gum has specific properties regarding pH stability, temperature tolerance, and interaction with other ingredients.

**Key Points**:
- Multiple sources: plants, seaweed, bacteria, tree exudates
- Pectin: gelling agent (jams, jellies), viscosity (ketchup)
- Alginates: suspending agent (from seaweed)
- Carrageenan: stabilizer in dairy products
- Xanthan gum: viscosity control, gluten-free baking
- Gum arabic: thickening agent in candies
- Each has specific functional properties

**Examples**:
- Pectin: jams, jellies, ketchup, tomato paste, fruit juices
- Alginates: salad dressings, puddings, ice cream
- Carrageenan: chocolate milk, ice cream, dairy desserts
- Xanthan gum: salad dressings, gluten-free bread
- Gum arabic: candies, beverages, confections

**Tags**: food-gums, pectin, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan-gum, gum-arabic, thickeners, stabilizers

#### Starch

**Summary**: Starch is a plant storage polysaccharide composed of glucose polymers (amylose and amylopectin) that is digestible by humans, with unique properties of gelatinization when heated with water and retrogradation upon cooling.

**Detailed Content**:
Starch is the primary energy storage polysaccharide in plants, consisting of glucose molecules linked by α-1,4 and α-1,6 glycosidic bonds, making it digestible by human enzymes. Starch exists in plant materials as starch granules - densely packed bundles of starch molecules. Each granule contains two types of molecules: **amylose** (linear chains, typically 20-30% of starch) and **amylopectin** (branched chains with α-1,6 branch points, typically 70-80%). Normal corn starch has a 1:3 amylose:amylopectin ratio. Raw starch is insoluble in cold water. **Gelatinization** occurs when starch is heated with water: heat weakens bonds between amylose and amylopectin, allowing water molecules to move in and form hydrogen bonds. Granules swell (starting around 60-70°C) and eventually burst (complete by 85°C), releasing starch molecules. Amylose contributes to gel formation because linear chains can orient parallel and bond together. Amylopectin contributes to viscosity due to its bulky branched shape that prevents bonding. **Retrogradation** occurs during cooling/storage when linear amylose chains reorient into crystalline zones, causing syneresis (water loss), toughening, and gritty texture (stale bread). This is accelerated at refrigeration temperatures and can be partially reversed by reheating.

**Key Points**:
- Glucose polymer with α-1,4 and α-1,6 bonds (digestible)
- Two components: amylose (linear) and amylopectin (branched)
- Ratio typically 1:3 (amylose:amylopectin)
- Insoluble in cold water
- Gelatinization: heat + water causes swelling and bursting
- Amylose contributes to gel formation
- Amylopectin contributes to viscosity
- Retrogradation: recrystallization upon cooling (accelerated by refrigeration)

**Examples**:
- Sources: corn, potato, wheat, rice, tapioca
- Gelatinization: gravy, pudding, sauces thickening
- Gel formation: custards, starch-based desserts
- Retrogradation: stale bread, gritty pudding, refrigerated sauces
- Applications: thickener, binder, gel former

**Tags**: starch, amylose, amylopectin, gelatinization, retrogradation, glucose-polymer, digestible-polysaccharide

#### Cellulose

**Summary**: Cellulose is the most abundant carbohydrate polymer, consisting of glucose units linked by β-1,4 bonds making it indigestible by humans, serving as plant cell wall material and dietary fiber.

**Detailed Content**:
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide on Earth, forming the structural framework of plant cell walls. Like starch, cellulose consists of linear chains of glucose molecules, but with a critical difference: the glucose units are connected by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds rather than the α-1,4 bonds in starch. This seemingly small structural difference makes cellulose completely indigestible by humans, as we lack enzymes (cellulases) capable of breaking β-1,4 bonds. The β-linkage allows cellulose chains to pack tightly in parallel arrangements stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding, creating strong, rigid fibers. Cellulose is a major component of dietary fiber in human nutrition. While indigestible, it provides important health benefits including promoting digestive health, providing bulk, and affecting gut microbiome. Hemicellulose, another plant cell wall polysaccharide, is also part of dietary fiber. The inability to digest cellulose explains why humans cannot derive nutrition from grass, wood, or paper despite their high glucose content, whereas ruminant animals have cellulase-producing bacteria in their digestive systems.

**Key Points**:
- Most abundant carbohydrate polymer
- Glucose units linked by β-1,4 bonds
- Indigestible by humans (lack cellulase enzyme)
- Plant cell wall structural material
- Provides strength and rigidity to plants
- Major component of dietary fiber
- Distinct from starch only in bond type

**Examples**:
- Sources: all plant cell walls, wood, cotton, paper
- Dietary fiber: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, bran
- Structural applications: plant tissues, wood products
- Comparison: grass (indigestible cellulose) vs. starch (digestible)

**Tags**: cellulose, dietary-fiber, beta-linkage, indigestible, plant-cell-walls, structural-polysaccharide
